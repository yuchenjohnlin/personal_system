## Plan 
The first approach was to use SQLAlchemy to create a database because it helps you design databases in a OOP way. After that you migrate the database to create/alter tables. 

I think it is called ORM + migrations and chatgpt strongly recommends it.
The benfit of defining through python ORM is that you can track changes for long-term projects. 
Another benefit is the migration from SQLite to postgreSQL 
Here we use SQLAlchemy + Albemic

However, before that, I have to define the things that I need in the database.
